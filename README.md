# MLB: Python Edition âš¾
This game simulates a 5-inning baseball game through the Python Shell. As the player cycles through each pitch, the program displays the progress of the game, such as innings, outs, and players on base. The 2021 batting statistics of nine MLB players were used to calculate the likelihood of a base hit. Once the game is completed, the program generates a score for the "opposing" team to determine the winner.
